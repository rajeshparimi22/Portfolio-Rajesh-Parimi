# Rajesh Parimi — Portfolio

This is a simple **light-themed** portfolio website for Rajesh Parimi. It includes three pages, a shared stylesheet, and a small JavaScript file for the contact form.

## Folder contents
```
portfolio/
├── index.html          # Home page
├── projects.html       # Projects and details
├── contact.html        # Contact form (Name, Email, Gender, Interests, Bio)
├── style.css           # Shared styles (light theme)
├── script.js           # Form handling and small interactions
├── RAJESH PARIMI_5699DEVELOPER.pdf  # Your resume (if included)
└── README.md
```

## How to use / Deploy on GitHub Pages (quick)
1. Create a new repository on GitHub (e.g. `portfolio`).<br>
2. Upload the files from this folder (you can drag & drop in the web UI or push with git).<br>
3. Commit to the `main` branch.<br>
4. Go to **Settings → Pages** (or **Pages** in the repo sidebar).<br>
5. Under **Build and deployment** choose **Deploy from a branch**, set **Branch** to `main`, and **Folder** to `/ (root)`. Save.<br>
6. After a minute, your site will be live at: `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/`<br>

## Notes & Next steps
- The contact form currently logs submissions to the browser console. To receive emails, integrate with a server or a service like Formspree, Netlify Forms, or a simple backend.<br>
- You can replace the resume PDF with an updated one — keep the filename or update links in `index.html` accordingly.<br>
- Feel free to customize colors in `style.css` or add images to the folder.

If you want, I can also:
- Add social icons and links (GitHub, Twitter).
- Add simple animations or a profile photo.
- Convert the contact form to use Formspree (no backend required).
